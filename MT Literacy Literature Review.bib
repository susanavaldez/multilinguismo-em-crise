	abstract = {The funding of research on crisis translation within the Horizon 2020 agenda (cf. {INTERACT} – The International Network on Crisis Translation) shows a growing recognition of translation and interpreting (T\&I) as vital components of crisis communication;  however, reports on policy gaps and insufficient provision of linguistic
support in crises (Federici et al. 2019: 4) indicate that more research on the role of T\&I in disasters and crises and, in particular, on implementations of language technologies is needed. With the increasing adoption of machine translation ({MT}) among professional
translators and the general public, researchers have begun to investigate the use of post-editing machine translation ({PEMT}) in crisis translation workflows (Parra Escartín and Moniz 2020). In this context, it has been suggested that {PEMT} can increase productivity and maintain acceptable quality - even for translations between low-resource language combinations when suitable {MT} engines are available (Cadwell et al. 2019). Despite this growing interest and the increasing variety of publicly-available {MT} engines, there is little
data on the extent to which {PEMT} is being used in crises, and by whom. It has been noted, however, that the lack of integrated responses involving professional translators and interpreters leads to a heavy reliance on citizen translators, i.e. volunteer translators with or
without formal training. This large-scale volunteer involvement requires careful practical and ethical design and implementation of {PEMT} workflows, particularly in light of recent discussions on the notion of machine translation literacy (O’Brien and Ehrensberger-Dow
2020; Bowker and Buitrago Ciro 2019) and the availability of additional technologies such as speech recognition and synthesis. My paper will present the results of a questionnaire which surveys members of international humanitarian organisations and translator networks in the context of the {COVID}-19 pandemic to investigate existing crisis translation workflows, the use of {MT} and {PEMT}, translators’ profiles, content types required for translation, as well as communication channels. The insights gained from the questionnaire
responses will be used as a basis to discuss whether {PEMT} can satisfy the quality and productivity demands in crisis translation, and to investigate additional workflow steps (pre-editing, speech-enabled {PEMT}, etc.) that may improve {PEMT} output.},

            Machine translation ({MT}) is now firmly in the public eye. The media can reflect and influence the public
                    perception of {MT} and, by extension, of translation itself, but the news coverage of {MT} has to date remained largely unexplored.
                    This study draws on the news framing literature to present an analysis of how {MT} is described in the written press. Based on a
                    sample of 284 {MT}-focused newspaper articles, the news reporting on {MT} was found to be significantly more positive than negative.
                    This positive framing was unrelated to the launch of neural {MT}. Furthermore, the portrayal of {MT} in the press tended to lack
                    nuance, with few instances that raised awareness of the technology’s use implications. The study calls for higher standards in the
                    public discussion and promotion of {MT} and for more research on non-professional conceptualisations of translation technologies and
                    their role in communication.},

            {MT} literacy means knowing how {MT} works, how the technology can be useful in a particular context, and what the implications are of using it for various purposes. As {MT} usage grows, the necessity for {MT} literacy also grows. This knowledge forms part of the greater need for digital literacies. In this contribution, we relate {MT} literacy to the concept of cognitive load in professional translation production and in translator training scenarios. We then move beyond the sphere of translation studies to examine other use-case settings—crisis communication, academic writing and patent publishing—to consider how {MT} can offer solutions and how {MT} literacy can impact cognitively in those settings. We discuss how training in {MT} literacy can empower language professionals and present two proposals for course content designed for {MT} users in other sectors.},

	abstract = {As Catalonia becomes increasingly multicultural as a result of immigration on many levels, official government communications are received by speakers of numerous different languages. For some languages, this is achieved through the employment of qualified translators. For the non-official languages, however, there is increasing reliance on the use of free online machine translation, explicitly without human correction ("post-editing"). Here we survey the use of Google Translate on the official website of the Catalan health service, focusing on Covid-19 vaccination information in 2021-22. We identify the strategic advantages of machine translation and then compare them with main communication problems in terms of comprehensibility and actionability. It is concluded that most of the communication problems can be solved by a better understanding of machine-translation literacy, by the judicious use of translation-memory software and efficient post-editing, and most especially by writing texts in such a way that the machine-translation problems are solved before they appear ("pre-editing"). In the relative absence of policies for non-official languages, serious strategic planning is required in order to ensure that the benefits of machine translation work towards a more inclusive society, rather than alienate users who merely see their language being abused.},

We argue that this discussion should include technical and ethical considerations, with a focus on how to ensure that students are able to use {MT} critically, identifying and correcting errors, for future professional use. Finally, we discuss the thorny issue of evaluation for this type of digital literacy. The discussion is based on several experiments conducted with undergraduate students enrolled in their final year of a three-year program in applied languages. We also believe that the teaching of such skills should not be restricted to language students, since students of all disciplines use online translators, and may continue to do so throughout their professional lives.},

              In recent years, marked gains in the accuracy of machine translation ({MT}) outputs have greatly increased its viability as a tool to support the efforts of English as a foreign language ({EFL}) students to write in English. This study examines error corrections made by 58 Korean university students by comparing their original L2 texts to that of {MT} outputs. Based on the results of the error analysis, the error types were categorized into 12 categories. Students were divided into three distinctive groups to determine differences among them according to the frequency of errors in their writing. The
              t
              -test results reveal that the numbers of errors significantly decreased in the revised versions for most of the error types among all groups. The results of the regression analysis also reveal a positive correlation relationship between the number of changes and the reduction of errors. However, the results also indicate that although all groups made error corrections at similar rates, students who less frequently committed errors in their L2 texts (higher language proficiency groups) generally tended to correct a higher proportion of errors. Based on the findings, pedagogical implications are discussed regarding how {EFL} teachers can effectively incorporate {MT} into the classroom.},

              The use of machine translation ({MT}) in the academic context has increased in recent years. Hence, language teachers have found it difficult to ignore {MT}, which has led to some concerns. Among the concerns, its accuracy has become a major factor that shapes language teachers’ pedagogical decision to use {MT} in their language classrooms. Despite the urgency of the issue, studies on {MT} output quality in foreign language education remain scarce. Moreover, as {MT} is advancing every year, updated studies are imperative. Therefore, the present study investigated the quality of {MT} outputs (Google Translate) from Korean to English by comparing it with the English-translated texts of intermediate English as a foreign language students. The study also examined the factors within the source texts that affect the quality of {MT} outputs. Five trained evaluators examined multiple aspects of {MT} output samples (
              N
              = 104) and students’ English texts (
              N
              = 104), including mechanics, vocabulary, grammar, and context. The results showed that both texts were equally comprehensible, but {MT} outperformed the students in most aspects under investigation. The study further found that only two factors in the source texts – punctuation and sentence complexity – influenced {MT} output quality, whereas lexical and grammatical accuracy, lexical diversity, and contextual understanding did not affect it. Based on the results, the study presents classroom implications for using {MT} for educational purposes.},

	abstract = {Researchers in various disciplines are under increasing pressure to publish (or perish) in high-prestige journals that are usually in English, the current lingua franca of science. Although English language teaching is now being offered early in educational systems around the world, the current generation of medium-stage and established researchers in many countries may not have profited from that advantage (cf. Plo Alastrué \& Pérez-Llantada 2015). In order to access information about what research groups in their area of expertise are doing, they may be forced either to increase their receptive competence in the respective language or to resort to other scholars’ summaries and interpretations in a language they are comfortable in. The problem is accentuated when it comes to disseminating their own results. Gaining enough competence in writing academic English is an endeavor that can require years of work that researchers might wish to dedicate to their own disciplines instead. If they happen to have younger colleagues on their team who are confident in English, they might ask them to serve as ad-hoc language mediators and to assume the bulk of the work in producing English manuscripts and/or presenting at international conferences. The recent improvements in machine translation ({MT}) quality that have been widely broadcast in the media (e.g. Hassan et al. 2018) might provide a tempting alternative to both scientists and the media professionals who specialize in reporting science. For certain language combinations, the raw output from some of the freely available systems is convincingly, although often misleadingly (cf. Macken et al. 2019), fluent and might be seen as a quick, economical, accessible alternative to involving a third party who has the competence to provide professional translation. In this contribution, we present the results of a Swiss-wide survey of university staff and students that suggest that {MT} is being used far more widely that had previously been assumed, even in a country in which English language teaching has been a priority for decades. We will highlight some of the risks of uninformed use of this technology in science news flows and discuss how they can be mitigated though targeted training in {MT} literacy (Bowker \& Ciro 2019).},

            Machine Translation ({MT}), the process by which a computer engine such as Google Translate or Bing automatically
					translates a text from one language into another without any human involvement, is increasingly used in professional,
					institutional and everyday contexts for a wide range of purposes. While a growing number of studies has looked at professional
					translators and translation students, there is currently a lack of research on non-translator users and uses in multilingual
					contexts.
            This paper presents a survey examining how, when and why students at Leiden University’s Faculty of Humanities use
					{MT}. A questionnaire was used to determine which {MT} engines students use and for what purposes, and gauge their awareness of issues
					concerning privacy, academic integrity and plagiarism. The findings reveal a widespread adoption of Google Translate and indicate
					that students use {MT} predominantly to look up single words, as an alternative to a dictionary. Many seemed sceptical about the
					value of {MT} for educational purposes, and many assumed that the use of {MT} is not permitted by lecturers for graded assignments,
					especially in courses focusing on language skills.
            
              The results demonstrate a clear need for more {MT} literacy. Students may not need practical training in
              how
              to use {MT}, but there is much room for improvement in terms of
              when
              and
              why
              they use it.},

Depois de retomarmos discussões recentes sobre o uso da tradução e, principalmente, da tradução automática, na sala de aula de línguas, apresentamos a aplicação de um questionário anônimo elaborado no aplicativo Google Forms que serviu para testar nossas hipóteses de pesquisa: (H1) na produção escrita de textos em inglês, os/as discentes sentem necessidade de utilizar ferramentas de tradução automática; (H2) os/as discentes recorrem a essas ferramentas, pois têm dificuldade de aprendizado e/ou pouca afinidade com essa atividade; (H3) já que os/as discentes recorrem a ferramentas de tradução automática, é possível que estejam interessados/as em aprender a usá-las. A análise dos dados confirmou as hipóteses H1 e H3 e refutou a hipótese H2.

The paper presents research on ideologies related to the use of machine translation in the English language classroom of {CLAC}-{UFRJ} (Cursos de Línguas Aberto à Comunidade - Federal University of Rio de Janeiro), focusing on the students' perspectives. Following Volóchinov's view of ideology (1929 [2017]), we deconstruct the so-called negative role of translation in learning languages that has been addressed by other researchers (e.g. Malmkjær 2010). After reviewing recent debates on the use of translation and, especially, machine translation, in the language classroom, we discuss the application of an anonymous questionnaire to test our research hypotheses: (H1) students feel the need to use machine translation tools in writing productions; (H2) students use these tools because they have learning difficulties and/or don't relate to that activity; (H3) since students generally use machine translation tools, it is possible that they are interested in learning how to use them.

Both approaches require scholars to access material through other languages, and more people are turning to machine translation to help with this task. Machine translation has improved considerably in recent years with the introduction of artificial intelligence techniques such as machine learning; however, it is far from perfect and users who are not trained as professional translators need to improve their machine translation literacy to use this technology effectively. Machine translation literacy is less about acquiring techno-procedural skills and more about developing cognitive competences. In this way, machine translation literacy aligns with the overall direction of the Association of College \& Research Libraries’ (2015) Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education, which encourages a conceptual, rather than a skills-based, approach. This case study presents a pilot project in which machine translation literacy instruction was incorporated into a broader program of information literacy and delivered to first-year students—both Anglophone and non-Anglophone—at a Canadian university. Students were surveyed and, overall, they found the machine translation literacy module to be valuable and recommended that similar instruction be made available to all students. Academic librarians are well positioned to participate in the delivery of machine translation literacy instruction as part of a broader information literacy program, and in so doing, they can promote linguistic diversity and better enable students and researchers from all regions to participate in scholarly conversations.},

French speaking doctors were asked to use both systems to diagnose Arabic speaking patients. We report on the user’s interactions with both systems, the quality of translation, the participant’s ability to reach a diagnosis with the two systems as well as user satisfaction.},

	abstract = {Parallel texts in the form of Graded Readers have a long tradition in
                        foreign language learning. When presenting the translation in the reader’s
                        first language alongside the target language text, parallel texts offer
                        access to literary texts, to their stories, characters, plot developments,
                        and cultural content, without the need for time-consuming vocabulary or
                        grammar searches, which would otherwise distract from the enjoyment of the
                        texts. This chapter will describe and evaluate a teaching activity that
                        makes use of Google translation as parallel text. This activity exploits the
                        inconsistencies and obvious mistakes of the English machine translation as
                        incentives to undertake close reading of the affected passages in the
                        original foreign language text and to suggest a better translation. It
                        allows beginners and intermediate students to benefit from the aesthetic
                        qualities of literary texts while developing their grammatical accuracy and
                        cultural understanding through focus on form. The evaluation of its
                        effectiveness will be based on class discussions. Pedagogic translation
                        exercises are used to promote deep engagement with the foreign language. At
                        the same time, the students learn to appreciate the complexities of
                        translation both as a process and as a product and develop a critical
                        understanding of translated, especially machine translated, text. The
                        opportunity to improve inferior machine translations while engaging with
                        rich, multi-layered literary texts is shown to be a motivating activity for
                        language learners, who also develop their digital literacy with an
                        understanding of the shortcomings of machine translations.},
